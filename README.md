## Description

This activity presents a real-world situation The task is to create code for analyzing the financial records of a company. The dataset has been provided by the client.

I have been provided with a dataset composed of arrays with two fields: Date and Profit/Losses.

The task is to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

- The total number of months included in the dataset.

- The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

- The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
(Total/(Number of months - 1))

- The greatest increase in profits (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire period.

- The greatest decrease in losses (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire period.

# Expected Output
